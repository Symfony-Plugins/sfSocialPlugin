# sfSocialPlugin

## Overview

This plugin adds social network capabilities to your project's users.
So, in example, your users will be able to mutually add as contact,
send and receive messages, create groups, manage events, receive
notifications about all this stuff, and so on.

## Demo

A working demo is online at [http://social.garak.it/](http://social.garak.it/)

## Installation

To install (from your project's root):

    cd plugins;
    svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfSocialPlugin/trunk sfSocialPlugin

The package depends on sfGuardPlugin, as users are managed by it. There's also an
optional dependance from sfThumbnailPlugin (to create thumbnails for profile pictures)


## Usage

Enable plugins in your `ProjectConfiguration` class

    [php]
    // config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php
    public function setup()
    {
      // possibly add other plugins here...
      $this->enablePlugins(array('sfGuardPlugin', 'sfThumbnailPlugin', 'sfSocialPlugin'));
    }

Enable modules in your application settings

    [yml]
    # apps/frontend/config/settings.yml
    enabled_modules: [sfGuardAuth, sfSocialMessage, sfSocialEvent, sfSocialContact, sfSocialNotify, sfSocialUser, sfSocialGroup]
    # this list is not complete: customize on your needs

In you application's `lib/myUser.class.php`, set class to extend `sfSocialSecurityUser`

Edit `plugins/sfGuardPlugin/lib/model/sfGuardUser.php` and set class to extend
`sfSocialGuardUser` instead of `PluginsfGuardUser`. Do the same for `sfGuardUserPeer`,
making it extend `sfSocialGuardUserPeer` instead of `PluginsfGuardUserPeer`.

Note that plugin comes with full modules templates. To use customized templates, just
create under your application a module with the same name as the module you want
to customize (don't use `generate:module` task, just create the directory), then add your
custom templates inside.
If you prefer to use default templates, be aware that all forms inside are based on
list formatter (tables are ugly!), so you must add this code:

    [php]
    // lib/form/BaseFormPropel.class.php
    public function setup()
    {
      // default formatter to list (instead of table)
      $this->widgetSchema->setDefaultFormFormatterName('list');

      // i18n
      $this->widgetSchema->getFormFormatter()->setTranslationCatalogue('sfSocial');
    }

About user's profile, the schema comes with a definition for `sfGuardUserProfile`,
just to be ready-to-go. You can customize the schema for your needs, or just comment
that part if you already have `sfGuardUserProfile` defined elsewhere.
In case you customize, note that some templates from sfSocialUser module should be
adapted (see above).


## Roadmap

Currently Contact, Message, Event, User, and Notify modules are working, with functional tests.

The project aims to fully implement:

  * **Contact** system (aka friends system): search for other users, request
    contact, accept/deny contact request, see list of your contacts,
    categorize contacts in groups, see contacts of other users,
    see contact shared with other users, see "degrees of separation"

  * **Message** system: send a message, read received messages, reply to a
    message.

  * **Group** system: create a group, invite users to join, manage groups.

  * **Event** system: create an event, invite users to partecipate, confirm
    partecipation (yes/no/maybe)

  * **Comment** system: write commments, reply to comments. For groups, events
    and maybe for something else.

  * **Notification** system: a glue for all other systems. Notify your contacts
    when you do an action (add a contact, create an event, etc.)
